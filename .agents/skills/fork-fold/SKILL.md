description: Operate this fork-fold maintenance repository - append topic branches or PRs to the stack, rebuild the assembled branch, resolve stopped builds and record conflict resolutions, and report staleness.

# Load the pinned fork-fold guide

The complete operating guide comes from the `fork-fold` flake input pinned by
this repository, so its instructions match the installed tool.

Before operating the stack, run this from the repository root:

```sh
nix eval --no-write-lock-file --raw .#lib.forkFoldAgentGuide
```

Read the command's complete output and follow it as the authoritative
instructions for this task. Do not substitute a remembered or previously
loaded version of the guide.
